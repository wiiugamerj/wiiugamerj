## Hii! I'm WGJ (wiiugamerj).
### I am an amateur programmer and UI/UX designer. Doing Godot games/apps while designing in Figma.

🔗 **[Portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/wiiugamerj)**

**🌎 Languages:** Spanish, English, and Catalan.

ℹ️ **Current projects:** I am currently focusing on graphic design with Affinity, making a zine that is not publicly available.

**Personal projects I have previously worked on:**
- I had been working on a Just Dance fan game on Godot for two years before cancelling it to focus on other projects
- As a test to practice my skills on UI design and animations on Godot, I made a music player that downloaded music from a server

💻 **Knowledge:**
- GDScript (mainly making UIs)
- Figma UI/UX design
- MacOS, Windows and Debian Linux
- Unlocking phones' bootloader and _custom romming_

💁 **A bit more about me:** 
Since I was a kid, I have been interested in computing, which has led me to early learning about the basics of software and hardware, programming, etc. For more info and projects I've made, visit my [portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/wiiugamerj).
